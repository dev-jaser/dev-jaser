# Hello, World! I'm dev-jaser

### Iâ€™m a dedicated cybersecurity student and software developer with a passion for secure software development, encryption, and IT system security. My journey began in programmingâ€”developing web and mobile applications with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C#, and Javaâ€”before I transitioned into cybersecurity to deepen my expertise in safeguarding digital assets, securing data, and ensuring system integrity.

Today, as an IT: Cybersecurity student and hands-on practitioner, I specialize in building secure applications and designing intuitive cybersecurity solutions. My focus spans application security, secure authentication methods, and crafting innovative approaches that balance robust protection with user-friendly design. With a proven track record in leading technical projects, I excel in mitigating risks, protecting critical infrastructures, and delivering secure, scalable solutions. 

I am continuously learning and trying to add to my existing knowledge on all things related to computer science. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for my certifications in CompTIA A+, CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Server+, & Cisco CCNA 200-301.

My expertise extends to network security, penetration testing, and secure application design, all supported by a strong foundation in Agile methodologies and detailed technical documentation. I thrive in high-pressure environments where precision and collaboration are key, and I am driven by a commitment to making advanced security accessible without sacrificing usability.

Explore my GitHub portfolio to see how I bring secure technology solutions to lifeâ€”and letâ€™s connect to shape a safer, more resilient digital future together.
