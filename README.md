# Hello, World! I'm dev-jaser

### Aspiring cybersecurity engineer and AI researcher focused on developing secure, scalable systems at the intersection of machine learning, scientific computing, and sustainability. Currently working on an AI-driven polymer aging classification system using deep learning on Raman spectroscopy data as part of the AIRE 2025 Internship.

Skilled in Python, PyTorch, network security, and HPC environments. Experienced in building clean, modular ML pipelines from data ingestion to inference and evaluation. My work bridges academic research with applied engineering, emphasizing reproducibility, performance, and scientific clarity.

Driven by curiosity, clarity, and meaningful contribution ‚Äî whether I‚Äôm training CNNs on spectral data, configuring VLANs, or building tools to help others learn better and safer tech.
